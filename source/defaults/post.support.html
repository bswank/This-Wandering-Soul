<h2>Leafpub is Free Software</h2>
<p>There's "free" as in freedom and "free" as in beer, and while I very much appreciate both of those things, it's important to remember that <strong>even though software may be <em>free</em>, it takes a lot of time and money to develop, maintain, and support.</strong></p>
<p>I'm a lone developer with a business to run and a family to feed, so I can't spend all my time providing free support for Leafpub. If you need help, first <a href="https://leafpub.org/docs" target="_blank">check the docs</a>. If you can't find an answer there, please ask your question on the <a href="https://community.leafpub.org/" target="_blank">community forum</a> so we can all benefit.</p>
<h2>Contribute</h2>
